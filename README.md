# shark-trade-issues

This repository is an issue-only repository for the `shark-trade` project for community purpose.
Currently, we protect the source code as a MVP but, we're keeping the project's backlog open for anyone that wants to track the development progress and, be able to open feature request or bug report.
Feel free to open an issue to discuss and bring new ideas. If you want to collaborate with me as a developer, send me a message. I'll enjoy it. (:
